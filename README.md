# LWP_Vineyard_Features
This repository and another one ([LWP_Mapping_sUAS_California](https://github.com/RuiGao9/LWP_Mapping_sUAS_California)) support a peer-reviewed paper: Integrating Time-Series Meteorological Data and sUAS Information into a Machine Learning Framework for California Vineyard Water Stress Monitoring. This repository aims to use a Python program to generate seventeen features. Among the seventeen features, six features are extracted directly from the AggieAir images (red-, green-, blue-, near-Infrared-band image, digital surface model data, and thermal data), and eleven features are extracted from the vegetation-index image, which is generated based on the spectral images. The feature is generated at a 0.6-m pixel scale. The peer-reviewed work explains the exact algorithm.
“1_Data”, “2_Script”, “3_Results”, and “ReadME.pdf” are folders and documents packaged in this repository, and how to use this project is explained below.
